1.When approaching this project I made sure to layout the proper schema for my sql and making sure it was connected to my workbench

2. After creating that connection, I began to build out seeded information in the format of my tables I created
 
3. After creating data for my managers,employees, and departments. I began to build out my functions
 
4. The functions necessary for this project were viewing, inputing and intergrating connections between the employees and departments
 
5. My next step was creating the information that was going to asked to the user when using the management system

6. When creating these associations I made sure that each employee and department had an association

7. Once the functions were complete I made sure all my information was seeded and displayed properly in my terminal

8. Once my information was seeded and displayed I made sure that all functionality worked properly and all data made sense.
